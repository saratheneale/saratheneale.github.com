{"name":"Saratheneale.github.com","tagline":"You should make a bot for that","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\nMy name is Sara, and I'm a coder. I've been a little low on code lately, and I'm diving back into it by learning some JavaScript. I'll share with you! \r\n\r\nHere are a few JavaScript projects:\r\n\r\nChatBots IRC: These are Chrome applications that utilize the [Chrome Sockets API](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html). To get them to work, you'll have to load them as unpacked extensions and generate a background page. \r\n\r\n> * [OptimistBot](https://github.com/saratheneale/OptimistBot)- OptimistBot loves encouraging channel conversation. He says positive things when you mention him. \r\n> * [GoodbyeBot](https://github.com/saratheneale/goodbyeBot)- says goodbye and leaves the channel when someone says hello. GoodbyeBot was recently refactored to include an IRCClient Class. I have lots of bot ideas and don't want to copy paste.\r\n> * IRCClient - a class/library for basic IRC connecting using the [Chrome Sockets API] (http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html). This is incorporated into Goodbye Bot and OptimistBot. It doesn't have its own repo just yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[littleNoAd](https://github.com/saratheneale/littleNoAd)- a tiny ad blocker for my personal use.\r\n\r\n[LolCat Memory] (https://github.com/saratheneale/lolcatMemory) - Classic Memory tile game with randomly generated LolCat images. This was a Girl Develop It pair up programming exercise. My version navigates the DOM with plain JavaScript. I'll convert it to jQuery later for fun. \r\n\r\n[Loljban Memory]- Link Coming soon after some revision. [Lojban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban) is a constructed language based on predicate logic with a small but dedicated community learning and contributing to the language. A friend of mine is learning it. He saw LolCat Memory and wanted me to combine it Lojban words with images of cats related to the words. Hence Lol-jban Memory was born. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
