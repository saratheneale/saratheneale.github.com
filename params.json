I've been a little low on code lately, and I'm diving back into it by learning some JavaScript. I'll share with you! \r\n\r\nHere are a few JavaScript projects:\r\n\r\n[littleNoAd](https://github.com/saratheneale/littleNoAd)- a tiny ad blocker for my personal use.\r\n\r\nIRC: These are Chrome applications that utilize the [Chrome Sockets API](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html). To get them to work, you'll have to load them as unpacked extensions and generate a background page. \r\n\r\n> * [OptimistBot](https://github.com/saratheneale/jsircconnect)- OptimistBot loves encouraging channel conversation. He says positive things when you mention him. \r\n> * [GoodbyeBot](https://github.com/saratheneale/goodbyeBot)- says goodbye and leaves the channel when someone says hello. GoodbyeBot was recently refactored to include an IRCClient Class. I have lots of bot ideas and don't want to copy paste.\r\n> * IRCClient - a class/library for basic IRC connecting using the [Chrome Sockets API] (http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
