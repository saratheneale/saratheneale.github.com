        <h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>My name is Sara, and I'm a coder. I've been a little low on code lately, and I'm diving back into it by learning some JavaScript. I'll share with you! </p>

<p>Here are a few JavaScript projects:</p>

<p>ChatBots IRC: These are Chrome applications that utilize the <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html">Chrome Sockets API</a>. To get them to work, you'll have to load them as unpacked extensions and generate a background page. </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/saratheneale/jsircconnect">OptimistBot</a>- OptimistBot loves encouraging channel conversation. He says positive things when you mention him. </li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/saratheneale/goodbyeBot">GoodbyeBot</a>- says goodbye and leaves the channel when someone says hello. GoodbyeBot was recently refactored to include an IRCClient Class. I have lots of bot ideas and don't want to copy paste.</li>
<li>IRCClient - a class/library for basic IRC connecting using the <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html">Chrome Sockets API</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/saratheneale/littleNoAd">littleNoAd</a>- a tiny ad blocker for my personal use.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/saratheneale/lolcatMemory">LolCat Memory</a> - Classic Memory tile game with randomly generated LolCat images. This was a Girl Develop It pair up programming exercise. My version navigates the DOM with plain JavaScript. I'll convert it to jQuery later for fun. </p>

<p>[Loljban Memory]- Link Coming soon after some revision. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a> is a constructed language based on predicate logic with a small but dedicated community learning and contributing to the language. A friend of mine is learning it. He saw LolCat Memory and wanted me to combine it Lojban words with images of cats related to the words. Hence Lol-jban Memory was born. </p>
