<p>Hello there! I'm Sara. I'm a web developer, and always looking for more things to learn and explore. Here are a few of my projects from the process. Stay tuned for more updates!  </p>

<p>Here are a few JavaScript projects:</p>

<p> <a href="//saratheneale.github.io/lolcatMemory/">LolCat Memory (Demo)</a> <a href="https://github.com/saratheneale/lolcatMemory">(Code Repo)</a> - Classic Memory tile game with randomly generated LolCat images. This was a Girl Develop It pair up programming exercise. I implemented it in Backbone.js with a State Model pattern.</p>


<h5>Hackathon Projects</h5>

<p><a href="//github.com/hello-worm/hello-worm">Hello Worm</a> - Hello Worm is a compost monitoring system paired with a webapp that alerts you when your compost bin gets too hot or too dry for worm survival. Worms are crucial to getting good soil from compost. Hello Worm was conceived at the AT&T Women in Tech Hackathon in May 2013. The team has since made updates to the project and is figuring out what next steps are. See helloworm.com for more info. </p>
<p><a href="//github.com/saratheneale/choose_your_disaster">Choose_Your_Disaster</a> - A project to explore Maps APIs and show you the nearest high points in case of tsunami, and nearest police and fire stations. </p>
<p>  <a href="//github.com/teamwinit/yahoohackusa">Electivity</a>  <a href="//electivity1.herokuapp.com/survey/food">DEMO AVAILABLE!!</a>- Developed at the Yahoo! Hack USA in Oct 2013. Electivity is Tinder meets Yelp. Take a 30 second survey of restaurants around you to decide where to eat. Swype right for yes and left for no. </p>

<h5>Other Projects</h5>
<p>ChatBots IRC: These are Chrome applications that utilize the <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html">Chrome Sockets API</a>. To get them to work, you'll have to load them as unpacked extensions and generate a background page. </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="//github.com/saratheneale/OptimistBot">OptimistBot</a>- OptimistBot loves encouraging channel conversation. He says positive things when you mention him. </li>
<li>
<a href="//github.com/saratheneale/goodbyeBot">GoodbyeBot</a>- says goodbye and leaves the channel when someone says hello. GoodbyeBot was recently refactored to include an IRCClient Class. I have lots of bot ideas and don't want to copy paste.</li>
<li>IRCClient - a class/library for basic IRC connecting using the <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html">Chrome Sockets API</a>. This is incorporated into Goodbye Bot and OptimistBot. It doesn't have its own repo just yet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="//github.com/saratheneale/littleNoAd">littleNoAd</a>- a Chrome extension. A tiny ad blocker for my personal use.</p>


<p>[Loljban Memory]- Link Coming soon after some revision. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a> is a constructed language based on predicate logic with a small but dedicated community learning and contributing to the language. A friend of mine is learning it. He saw LolCat Memory and wanted me to combine it Lojban words with images of cats related to the words. Hence Lol-jban Memory was born. </p>
